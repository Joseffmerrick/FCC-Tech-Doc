          <p>There are many lenses that a photographer uses for a variety of different purposes. The key to a great portrait is selecting the one best suited for the job. In this section we'll go over a few basics to look for to obtain the desired shot.</p>
            <code></code>
          <p>The first thing you want to do is determine what type of portrait you are taking. Is it for a theatrical production? Is it a headshot for an actor or a business proffessional? What kind of drama do you want to convey with this image? Once you've figured that out you can select a lens suitable for the task.</p>
            <ul><h3>Here are a few lens styles and the effect they may have on your shot</h3>
              <li><b>Telephoto</b> (85mm and above): A longer lens can get you great compression, further seperating a subject from its background. It also allows the photographer to keep distance from the subject which can decrease tension. <b>Great for: Headshots, Professional Portraits and Certain Fashion Portraits.</b>
              </li><br>
              <li><b>Medium Focal Length</b> (From 35mm to 85mm): This class can still include up to the 85mm lens and can vary in the type of drama it can produce. It can still get great proffesional portraits in the upper half of the range but can begin to mimic the perseption of the human eye in the lower half. Keep in mind how much you can open your f-stop on the lens, the wider it opens, the shallower your depth of field which can give  you more control over where the viewer focuses their attention. <b>Great for: Professional Portraits on the higher, Lifestyle and Family/Group Portraits on the lower end.</b>
              </li><br>
              <li><b>Wide Angle Lenses</b> (35mm and lower): Wide angle lenses are great for introducing a little more drama into an image. They have a proclivity for distorting images which makes for some great close up shots. They also allow you to include more of the environment to tell your story with. <b> Great for: Theatrical Portraits and telling a larger story. </b></li>
            </ul>

        <header>Making Your Subject Feel at Ease</header>
          <p>One thing that breaks from the comfort of the technical aspects of photography is knowing how to make a subject feel comfortable in front of the camera. Of course you will often shoot with subjects who are experienced and need little to no coaching but you will often find yourself doing portraits with folks who never spend time in front of a camera or despise the experience all together.<br>Below are a few ways to help them into being a rockstar subject.</p>
            <code></code>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Have a Chat:</b> Before you even start pointing a camera intheir direction, have a little chat with your subject. Get to know them, what makes them tick. This will make them feel more comfortable with you and then later, when you are taking pictures, it will give you something to bring up to get them out of their head.</li><br>
                <li><b>Ask For a Best Side:</b> In the age of Instagram and selfies, most people already know their "best side" so... just ask. If the subject feels that their interests are being taken care of they'll be much more cooperative when the shutter is going. </li><br>
                <li><b>Take Their Mind of the Camera:</b>Remember when you had that chat before you were even shooting? Now is the time to start chatting about their life. When a father talks about his kids he'll open up in a way that would amaze you. A traveler could go on for hours about their trip through South-East Asia and completely forget your shooting.</li><br>
                <li><b>Build a Common Language:</b>Inevitably there will be technical stuff that breaks up the comfort a little (i.e. lifting the chin, posing, finding light, etc.). When you start with a subject build a language that's simple for you to use throughout the shoot so you don't have to break away from the comfort you've already built. For example, let them know that when you move your hand in such a way it means to lift their a chin a little bit. These techniques will keep the content flowing.</li><br>
                <li><b>Show Them the Goods:</b> Every once in awhile when you caught a really good image... show the subject. They'll see it and feel like the super star they are and that little ego boost will go a long way.</li>
          <p>Now that we got all the relational stuff out of the way... on to the technical!</p>

        <header>Honing in Your Settings</header>
          <p>We've selected our lenses and got to know our subject a little, now we have to get our setting keyed in. This is arguably the most important step. Below is a list of what to look for and how to set for it.</p>
            <code></code>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Will there be movement?</b> If you are doing a portrait in which the subject will be moving as opposed to static you'll need to select a high shutter speed to freeze the movement. With a higher shutter speed you will lose light on your sensor, if you are using natural light you'll have to adjust for this with a wider aperture or a higher ISO. Keep in mind that there are sacrifices with both. With a wider aperture you will lose depth of field making it harder to get focus on a moving subject. With higher ISO you risk adding noise to your image. It's up to you to find the balance that best suits the situation.</li><br>
              <li><b>Shallow or Wide?</b> With headshots or professional portraits you generaly want to draw the attention to the eyes. This means opening your aperture as wide as it goes to focus on the eye nearest the camera. This will also allow you to shoot with a low ISO and a high Shutter Speed, great news. But it may be difficult to get that tight of focus, sad face. Use a tripod if you need to and take more photos than you may be used to. A wide depth of field (close down that aperture) is great for dramatic shots where the environment is important to telling the story. You'll need more light here or a slower shutter, watch for blur.</li><br>
              <li><b>To ISO or Not to ISO?</b> Know thy camera well! As technology advances the ability of higher ISO settings to produce less noise in an image is getting better. Go on Youtube or Google and do some research on your cameras ISO settings and their ability crank up without losing image clarity.</li><br>
              <li><b>Have You Checked Your White Balance?</b> Checking your white balance is all to often forgot when going through list of todos when honing in your settings. Of course, if you're shooting in RAW (and you should be) you can make adjustments later. However, especially if you are shooting in multiple locations and you left your WB on Tungsten, you'll end up with a variety of problems to fix in post. Set it now, change it as needed, or keep it on auto, just make sure you remember it's there.</li><br>
              <li><b>Why Worry About Metering Modes?</b> Because if you know how to use them, they will streamline your shooting process. More time with your eye in the view finder and less time double checking your exposures. Check out some tutorials and get the metering modes down.</li><br>
            </ol>
          <p>Now that we've got our setting dialed in let's get to shooting.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Framing_Your_Image">
        <header>Framing Your Image</header>
          <p>Framing your image goes the longest way to telling your story.<br>
          <b>What's important in your image?</b> is it just the face/head of the subject or is the background telling a story too? <br>
          <b>How do the lines of the image come together?</b> Is the way in which the leading lines in your framing support or detract from what's important? Is there a telephone pole coming out of the top of your subjects head? <br>
          <b>Are you framing for a flatter image or a deeper one?</b> It's so easy to forget that the image, though 2D, is a representation of a 3D world. Are we framing for 3 Dimensions?
          </p>
            <code></code>
          <p> <b>Learn the Rule of Thirds:</b> <br>
            The rule of thirds is the first thing every photographer should learn about framing. As with every rule, they can be broken effectively, but to break it effectively you must first live by it. <br>
            Imagine your view finder with two verticle lines cutting the image vertically into thirds and two horizontal lines cutting the image horizontally into thirds. Looks like tic-tac-toe right? Where those lines converge is the sweet spot, the human eye naturally comes to those spots in an image. Use them to your advantage by placing the important parts of your portraits in those areas (i.e. the nearest eye). <br>

      <section class="main-section" id="Posing_Your_Subject">
        <header>Posing Your Subject</header>
          <p>As we mentioned before, posing your subject involves creating a common language between you. Once you've done that the rest of it is really up to you. Of course there are tricks that work for most photographers but it comes down to whether or not the content that you are creating pleases your eye. If you are working for a client they likely chose to work with you because they like the work you do. Trust yourself. <br>
            Of course it never hurts to broaden your repretoire of poses. As I see it, there are two ways to do this: 1. Experiment on your own, work with a model you enjoy working with and try some stuff out. 2. Find photographers you like and research their content. These days they're not only likely to have websites and instagrams but they may also have a tutorial or two up specifically on posing. Check it out and don't get too caught up in the right and wrong of posing a subject.
